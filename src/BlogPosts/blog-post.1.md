# Sample blog post

#### September 7, 2021 by [Danny](/)

This blog post is an introduction from me! Hello!

## What's new in life

At the time of writing this, I am in St. Louis, trying to get back into digital photography, as well as film, using an old Canon AE-1 Program that I have. I also wanted to finally complete this website and get it out to the world, as that has been put off for years since graduation.

### Other notes

1. I am hungry, but when am I not?
2. I woke up early to go to the gym, and am paying for it in energy levels at the moment.
3. If anyone has good film advice, do let me know.
4. At the time of writing this, the images on this website are randomly generated. I will replace them with my own work soon.

That's all! Thanks for reading. I am hopeful that there will be more mundane posts to accompany this one! :)
